For example, the ROT-13 cypher just exchanges a letter with the letter thirteen places before or after it in the alphabet. For example, HELLO becomes URYYB. Applying the algorithm again decodes the message, turning URYYB back into HELLO. Substitution ciphers are easy to break, but the basic idea can be extended to create cryptographic systems that are practically uncrackable. For example, a one-time pad is a system that uses a di erent substitution for each letter in the message. So long as a particular set of substitutions is not used on more than one message, the one-time pad is unbreakable. English characters are often stored in computers in the ASCII format. In ASCII, a single character is represented by a string of eight bits, which we can consider as a vector in Z8 2(which is like vectors in R8, where the entries are zeros and ones). One way to create a substitution cipher, then, is to choose an 8\u00028invertible bit matrix M, and multiply each letter of the message by M. Then to decode the message, each string of eight characters would be multiplied by M\u00001. To make the message a bit tougher to decode, one could consider pairs (or longer sequences) of letters as a single vector in Z16 2(or a higher-dimensional space), and then use an appropriately-sized invertible matrix.

We also know that the determinant is a multiplicative function, in the sense that det( MN) = detMdetN. Now we will devise some methods for calculating the determinant. Recall that: detM=X \u001bsgn(\u001b)m1 \u001b(1)m2 \u001b(2)\u0001\u0001\u0001mn \u001b(n): Aminor of ann\u0002nmatrixMis the determinant of any square matrix obtained from Mby deleting one row and one column. In particular, any entrymi jof a square matrix Mis associated to a minor obtained by deleting theith row and jth column of M. It is possible to write the determinant of a matrix in terms of its minors as follows: detM=X \u001bsgn(\u001b)m1 \u001b(1)m2 \u001b(2)\u0001\u0001\u0001mn \u001b(n) =m1 1X =\u001b1sgn(=\u001b1)m2 =\u001b1(2)\u0001\u0001\u0001mn =\u001b1(n) +m1 2X =\u001b2sgn(=\u001b2)m2 =\u001b2(1)m3 =\u001b2(3)\u0001\u0001\u0001mn =\u001b2(n) +m1 3X =\u001b3sgn(=\u001b3)m2 =\u001b3(1)m3 =\u001b3(2)m4 =\u001b3(4)\u0001\u0001\u0001mn =\u001b3(n) +\u0001\u0001\u0001 Here the symbols =\u001bkrefers to the permutation \u001bwith the input kremoved. The summand on the j'th line of the above formula looks like the determinant of the minor obtained by removing the rst and j'th column of M. However we still need to replace sum of =\u001bjby a sum over permutations of column numbers of the matrix entries of this minor. This costs a minus sign whenever j\u00001 is odd. In other words, to expand by minors we pick an entry m1 jof the rst row, then add ( \u00001)j\u00001times the determinant of the matrix with row i and column jdeleted. An example will probably help: 186\n",

Although, the question does not ask you to, it is a useful exercise to verify that all ten vector space rules are satis ed. (c) This is not a vector space for many reasons. An easy one is that (1;\u00001;0) and (\u00001;1;0) are both in the space, but their sum (0 ;0;0) is not ( i.e., additive closure fails). The easiest way to repair this would be to drop the requirement that there be at least one entry equaling\n",

First we check additive closure: let0 @x y 01 Aand 0 @z w 01 Abe arbitrary vectors in U. But since0 @x y 01 A+0 @z w 01 A=0 @x+z y+w 01 A, so is their sum (because vectors in Uare those whose third component vanishes). Multiplicative closure is similar: for any 2R, 0 @x y 01 A= 0 @ x y 01 A, which also has no third component, so is in U. (b) This is not a vector space for various reasons. A simple one is that u=0 @1 0 z1 Ais inUbut the vector u+u=0 @2 0 2z1 Ais not inU(it has a 2 in the rst component, but vectors in Ualways have a 1 there). 10.0 BB@1 1\u00001 2 1 3 2 2 \u00001\u00003\u00004 6 0 4 7\u000021 CCA=0 BB@1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 \u00001 0 1 0 0 0 0 11 CCA0 BB@1 1\u00001 2 0 2 3 0 0\u00002\u00005 8 0 4 7\u000021 CCA 329330 Sample First Midterm =0 BB@1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 \u00001\u00001 1 0 0 2 0 11 CCA0 BB@1 1\u00001 2 0 2 3 0 0 0\u00002 8 0 0 1\u000021 CCA =0 BB@1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 \u00001\u00001 1 0 0 2\u00001 211 CCA0 BB@1 1\u00001 2 0 2 3 0 0 0\u00002 8 0 0 0 21 CCA: To solveMX =VusingM=LUwe rst solve LW=Vwhose augmented matrix reads 0 BB@1 0 0 0 7 1 1 0 0 6 \u00001\u00001 1 0 12 0 2\u00001 21\u000071 CCA\u00180 BB@1 0 0 0 7 0 1 0 0\u00001 0 0 1 0 18 0 2\u00001 21\u000071 CCA \u00180 BB@1 0 0 0 7 0 1 0 0\u00001 0 0 1 0 18 0 0 0 1 41 CCA; from which we can read o W.

The angle is not a ected by scaling each of the vectors by a positive scalar: We have, for any vectors aandb, and any positive numbers and , 6( a; b ) =6(a;b): Acute and obtuse angles. Angles are classi ed according to the sign of aTb. Supposeaandbare nonzero vectors of the same size. \u000fIf the angle is \u0019=2 = 90\u000e,i.e.,aTb= 0, the vectors are said to be orthogonal . We writea?bifaandbare orthogonal. (By convention, we also say that a zero vector is orthogonal to any vector.) \u000fIf the angle is zero, which means aTb=kakkbk, the vectors are aligned . Each vector is a positive multiple of the other. \u000fIf the angle is \u0019= 180\u000e, which means aTb=\u0000kakkbk, the vectors are anti- aligned .

Ifn-vectorsxandyrepresent the word counts for two documents, their angle 6(x;y) can be used as a measure of document dissimilarity. (When using angle to measure document dissimilar- ity, either word counts or histograms can be used; they produce the same result.) As an example, table 3.2 gives the angles in degrees between the word histograms in the example at the end of x3.2.\n",
      "840 (3) We conclude that the vectors e1;l1;:::;ln\u00001are linearly independent, and therefore a basis. This means that any cash ow n-vectorccan be expressed as a linear combi- nation of ( i.e., replicated by) an initial payment and one period loans: c= 1e1+ 2l1+\u0001\u0001\u0001+ nln\u00001: It is possible to work out what the coe\u000ecients are (see exercise 5.3). The most interesting one is the rst coe\u000ecient 1=c1+c2 1 +r+\u0001\u0001\u0001+cn (1 +r)n\u00001; which is exactly the net present value (NPV) of the cash ow, with interest rate r. Thus we see that anycash ow can be replicated as an income in period 1 equal to its net present value, plus a linear combination of one-period loans at interest rater. Proof of independence-dimension inequality. The proof is by induction on the dimensionn. First consider a linearly independent collection a1;:::;akof 1-vectors. We must have a16=\n",
      "163 (4) This means that every element aiof the collection can be expressed as a multiple ai= (ai=a1)a1of the rst element a1. This contradicts linear independence unless k=\n",

We partition the vectors as ai=\u0014bi i\u0015 ; i= 1;:::;k; wherebiis an (n\u00001)-vector and iis a scalar. First suppose that 1=\u0001\u0001\u0001= k=\n",
      "397 (6) Then the vectors b1;:::;bkare linearly independent:Pk i=1 ibi= 0 holds if and only ifPk i=1 iai= 0, which is only possible for 1=\u0001\u0001\u0001= k= 0 because the vectors aiare linearly independent. The vectors b1;:::;bktherefore form a linearly independent collection of ( n\u00001)- vectors. By the induction hypothesis we have k\u0014n\u00001, so certainly k\u0014n. Next suppose that the scalars iare not all zero. Assume j6=\n",
      "284 (7) We de ne a collection of k\u00001 vectorsciof lengthn\u00001 as follows: ci=bi\u0000 i jbj; i= 1;:::;j\u00001; ci=bi+1\u0000 i+1 jbj; i=j;:::;k\u00001: Thesek\u00001 vectors are linearly independent: IfPk\u00001 i=1 ici= 0 then j\u00001X i=1 i\u0014bi i\u0015 + \u0014bj j\u0015 +kX i=j+1 i\u00001\u0014bi i\u0015 = 0 (5.2) with =\u00001 j(j\u00001X i=1 i i+kX i=j+1 i\u00001 i):\n",
      "3603 (8) It is also common to describe this collection of vectors using the transpose of that matrix. In this case, we give the vectors as an N\u0002n matrixX. Itsith row isxT i, the transpose of the ith vector. Its jth column gives the value of the jth entry (or feature) across the collection of Nvectors. When an author refers to a data matrix orfeature matrix , it can usually be determined from context (for example, its dimensions) whether they mean the data matrix organized by rows or columns. Symmetric matrix. A square matrix Aissymmetric ifA=AT,i.e.,Aij=Aji for alli;j. Symmetric matrices arise in several applications. For example, suppose thatAis the adjacency matrix of a graph or relation (see page 112). The matrix A is symmetric when the relation is symmetric, i.e., whenever ( i;j)2R, we also have (j;i)2R. An example is the friend relation on a set ofnpeople, where ( i;j)2R means that person iand person jare friends. (In this case the associated graph is called the `social network graph'.) 6.3.2 Matrix addition Two matrices of the same size can be added together. The result is another matrix of the same size, obtained by adding the corresponding elements of the two matrices. For example,2 40 4 7 0 3 13 5+2 41 2 2 3 0 43 5=2 41 6 9 3 3 53 5: Matrix subtraction is similar. As an example, \u00141 6 9 3\u0015 \u0000I=\u00140 6 9 2\u0015 : (This gives another example where we have to gure out the size of the identity matrix. Since we can only add or subtract matrices of the same size, Irefers to a 2\u00022 identity matrix.) Properties of matrix addition. The following important properties of matrix ad- dition can be veri ed directly from the de nition. We assume here that A,B, and Care matrices of the same size.6.3 Transpose, addition, and norm 117 \u000fCommutativity. A+B=B+A. \u000fAssociativity. (A+B) +C=A+ (B+C). We therefore write both as A+B+C. \u000fAddition with zero matrix. A+ 0 = 0 +A=A. Adding the zero matrix to a matrix has no e ect. \u000fTranspose of sum. (A+B)T=AT+BT. The transpose of a sum of two matrices is the sum of their transposes. 6.3.3 Scalar-matrix multiplication Scalar multiplication of matrices is de ned in a similar way as for vectors, and is done by multiplying every element of the matrix by the scalar. For example (\u00002)2 41 6 9 3 6 03 5=2 4\u00002\u000012 \u000018\u00006 \u000012 03 5: As with scalar-vector multiplication, the scalar can also appear on the right. Note that 0A= 0 (where the left-hand zero is the scalar zero, and the right-hand 0 is the zero matrix). Several useful properties of scalar multiplication follow directly from the de ni- tion. For example, ( A)T= (AT) for a scalar and a matrix A. IfAis a matrix and , are scalars, then ( + )A= A+ A; ( )A= ( A): It is useful to identify the symbols appearing in these two equations. The + symbol on the left of the left-hand equation is addition of scalars, while the + symbol on the right of the left-hand equation denotes matrix addition. On the left side of the right-hand equation we see scalar-scalar multiplication ( ) and scalar-matrix multiplication; on the right we see two cases of scalar-matrix multiplication. Finally, we mention that scalar-matrix multiplication has higher precedence than matrix addition, which means that we should carry out multiplication before addition (when there are no parentheses to x the order). So the right-hand side of the left equation above is to be interpreted as ( A) + ( A). 6.3.4 Matrix norm The norm of an m\u0002nmatrixA, denotedkAk, is the squareroot of the sum of the squares of its entries, kAk=vuutmX i=1nX j=1A2 ij: (6.3)118 6 Matrices This agrees with our de nition for vectors when Ais a vector, i.e.,n=\n",
      "512 (9) The norm of an m\u0002nmatrix is the norm of an mn-vector formed from the entries of the matrix (in any order). Like the vector norm, the matrix norm is a quantitative measure of the magnitude of a matrix. In some applications it is more natural to use the RMS values of the matrix entries, kAk=pmn, as a measure of matrix size. The RMS value of the matrix entries tells us the typical size of the entries, independent of the matrix dimensions. The matrix norm (6.3) satis es the properties of any norm, given on page\n",
      "1586 (10) For anym\u0002nmatrixA, we havekAk\u00150 (i.e., the norm is nonnegative), and kAk= 0 only ifA= 0 (de niteness). The matrix norm is nonnegative homogeneous: For any scalar andm\u0002nmatrixA, we havek Ak=j jkAk. Finally, for any two m\u0002nmatricesAandB, we have the triangle inequality, kA+Bk\u0014kAk+kBk: (The plus symbol on the left-hand side is matrix addition, and the plus symbol on the right-hand side is addition of numbers.) The matrix norm allows us to de ne the distance between two matrices as kA\u0000Bk. As with vectors, we can say that one matrix is close to, or near, another one if their distance is small. (What quali es as small depends on the application.) In this book we will only use the matrix norm (6.3). Several other norms of a matrix are commonly used, but are beyond the scope of this book. In contexts where other norms of a matrix are used, the norm (6.3) is called the Frobenius norm , after the mathematician Ferdinand Georg Frobenius, and is usually denoted with a subscript, as kAkF. One simple property of the matrix norm is kAk=kATk,i.e., the norm of a matrix is the same as the norm of its transpose. Another one is kAk2=ka1k2+\u0001\u0001\u0001+kank2; wherea1;:::;anare the columns of A. In other words: The squared norm of a matrix is the sum of the squared norms of its columns. 6.4 Matrix-vector multiplication IfAis anm\u0002nmatrix and xis ann-vector, then the matrix-vector product y=Ax is them-vectorywith elements yi=nX k=1Aikxk=Ai1x1+\u0001\u0001\u0001+Ainxn; i= 1;:::;m: (6.4) As a simple example, we have \u00140 2\u00001 \u00002 1 1\u00152 42 1 \u000013 5=\u0014(0)(2) + (2)(1) + ( \u00001)(\u00001) (\u00002)(2) + (1)(1) + (1)( \u00001)\u0015 =\u00143 \u00004\u0015 :\n",

      "281 (12) This ow can be explained in words: The unit external ow entering node 1 splits three ways, with 0 :6 owing up, 0:3 owing right, and 0 :1 owing diagonally up (on edge 4). The upward ow on edge 1 passes through node 2, where ow is conserved, and proceeds right on edge 3 towards node\n",

A graph is also useful when we focus on the values of some quantity at each graph vertex or node. Let vbe ann-vector, often interpreted as a potential , withvithe potential value at node i. We can give a simple interpretation to the matrix-vector product u=ATv. Them-vectoru=ATvgives the potential di erences across the edges: uj=vl\u0000vk, where edge jgoes from node kto nodel. Dirichlet energy. When them-vectorATvis small, it means that the potential di erences across the edges are small. Another way to say this is that the potentials of connected vertices are near each other. A quantitative measure of this is the function of vgiven by D(v) =kATvk2: This function arises in many applications, and is called the Dirichlet energy (or Laplacian quadratic form ) associated with the graph. It can be expressed as D(v) =X edges (k;l)(vl\u0000vk)2; which is the sum of the squares of the potential di erences of vacross all edges in the graph. The Dirichlet energy is small when the potential di erences across the edges of the graph are small, i.e., nodes that are connected by edges have similar potential values. The Dirichlet energy is used as a measure the non-smoothness (roughness) of a set of node potentials on a graph. A set of node potentials with small Dirichlet energy can be thought of as smoothly varying across the graph. Conversely, a set of potentials with large Dirichlet energy can be thought of as non-smooth or rough. The Dirichlet energy will arise as a measure of roughness in several applications we will encounter later. As a simple example, consider the potential vector v= (1;\u00001;2;\u00001) for the graph shown in gure 7.2. For this set of potentials, the potential di erences across the edges are relatively large, with ATv= (\u00002;\u00002;3;\u00001;\u00003), and the associated Dirichlet energy is kATvk2=\n",
      "1227 (15) Now consider the potential vector v= (1;2;2;1). The associated edge potential di erences are ATv= (1;0;0;\u00001;\u00001), and the Dirichlet energy has the much smaller value kATvk2= 3.136 7 Matrix examples 1 2 3 n1 2 3 n−1 Figure 7.4 Chain graph. 0 20 40 60 80 1000123 kak 0 20 40 60 80 1000123 kbk Figure 7.5 Two vectors of length 100, with Dirichlet energy D(a) = 1:14 and D(b) = 8:99. Chain graph. The incidence matrix and the Dirichlet energy function have a particularly simple form for the chain graph shown in gure 7.4, with nvertices andn\u00001 edges. The n\u0002(n\u00001) incidence matrix is the transpose of the di erence matrixDdescribed on page 119, in (6.5). The Dirichlet energy is then D(v) =kDvk2= (v2\u0000v1)2+\u0001\u0001\u0001+ (vn\u0000vn\u00001)2; the sum of squares of the di erences between consecutive entries of the n-vectorv. This is used as a measure of the non-smoothness of the vector v, considered as a time series. Figure 7.5 shows an example. 7.4 Convolution The convolution of ann-vectoraand anm-vectorbis the (n+m\u00001)-vector denotedc=a\u0003b, with entries ck=X i+j=k+1aibj; k = 1;:::;n +m\u00001; (7.2) where the subscript in the sum means that we should sum over all values of iand jin their index ranges 1 ;:::;n and 1;:::;m , for which the sum i+jisk+\n",

The matrix Aand the vector bin the representation of an a\u000ene function as f(x) =Ax+bare unique. These parameters can be obtained by evaluating fat the vectors 0, e1;:::;en, whereekis thekth unit vector in Rn.

In these cases we refer to the linear function relating the two sets of variables as a model or an approximation , to remind us that the relation is only an approximation, and not exact. We give a few examples here. \u000fPrice elasticity of demand. Considerngoods or services with prices given by then-vectorp, and demands for the goods given by the n-vectord. A change in prices will induce a change in demands. We let \u000epricebe then-vector that gives the fractional change in the prices, i.e.,\u000eprice i = (pnew i\u0000pi)=pi, wherepnewis then-vector of new (changed) prices. We let \u000edembe then- vector that gives the fractional change in the product demands, i.e.,\u000edem i= (dnew i\u0000di)=di, wherednewis then-vector of new demands. A linear demand elasticity model relates these vectors as \u000edem=Ed\u000eprice, whereEdis then\u0002n demand elasticity matrix . For example, suppose Ed 11=\u00000:4 andEd 21= 0:2. This means that a 1% increase in the price of the rst good, with other prices kept the same, will cause demand for the rst good to drop by 0 :4%, and demand for the second good to increase by 0 :2%. (In this example, the second good is acting as a partial substitute for the rst good.) \u000fElastic deformation. Consider a steel structure like a bridge or the structural frame of a building. Let fbe ann-vector that gives the forces applied to the structure at nspeci c places (and in nspeci c directions), sometimes called a loading . The structure will deform slightly due to the loading. Let dbe anm-vector that gives the displacements (in speci c directions) of m points in the structure, due to the load, e.g., the amount of sag at a speci c point on a bridge. For small displacements, the relation between displacement and loading is well approximated as linear: d=Cf, whereCis them\u0002n compliance matrix .

(This is just the rst-order Taylor approximation of each of the scalar-valued functions fi, described inx2.2.) Forxnearz,^f(x) is a very good approximation of f(x). We can express this approximation in compact notation, using matrix-vector multiplication, as ^f(x) =f(z) +Df(z)(x\u0000z); (8.3) where them\u0002nmatrixDf(z) is the derivative orJacobian matrix offatz (seexC.1). Its components are the partial derivatives of f, Df(z)ij=@fi @xj(z); i= 1;:::;m; j = 1;:::;n; evaluated at the point z. The rows of the Jacobian are rfi(z)T, fori= 1;:::;m . The Jacobian matrix is named for the mathematician Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi. As in the scalar-valued case, Taylor approximation is sometimes written with a second argument as ^f(x;z) to show the point zaround which the approximation is made. Evidently the Taylor series approximation ^fis an a\u000ene function of x. (It is often called a linear approximation of f, even though it is not, in general, a linear function.) 8.2.2 Regression model Recall the regression model (2.7) ^y=xT +v; (8.4) where then-vectorxis a feature vector for some object, is ann-vector of weights, vis a constant (the o set), and ^ yis the (scalar) value of the regression model prediction. Now suppose we have a set of Nobjects (also called samples orexamples ), with feature vectors x(1);:::;x(N). The regression model predictions associated with the examples are given by ^y(i)= (x(i))T +v; i = 1;:::;N: These numbers usually correspond to predictions of the value of the outputs or responses. If in addition to the example feature vectors x(i)we are also given the152 8 Linear equations actual value of the associated response variables, y(1);:::;y(N), then our prediction errors orresiduals are r(i)=y(i)\u0000^y(i); i= 1;:::;N: (Some authors de ne the prediction errors as ^ y(i)\u0000y(i).) We can express this using compact matrix-vector notation. We form the n\u0002N feature matrix Xwith columns x(1);:::;x(N). We letyddenote theN-vector whose entries are the actual values of the response for the Nexamples. (The superscript `d' stands for `data'.) We let ^ yddenote theN-vector of regression model predictions for theNexamples, and we let rddenote the N-vector of residuals or prediction errors. We can then express the regression model predictions for this data set in matrix-vector form as ^yd=XT +v1: The vector of Nprediction errors for the examples is given by rd=yd\u0000^yd=yd\u0000XT \u0000v1: We can include the o set vin the regression model by including an additional feature equal to one as the rst entry of each feature vector: ^yd=\u0014 1T X\u0015T\u0014v \u0015 =~XT~ ; where ~Xis the new feature matrix, with a new rst row of ones, and ~ = (v; ) is the vector of regression model parameters. This is often written without the tildes, as ^yd=XT , by simply including the feature one as the rst feature. The equation above shows that the N-vector of predictions for the Nexamples is a linear function of the model parameters ( v; ). TheN-vector of prediction errors is an a\u000ene function of the model parameters. 8.3 Systems of linear equations Consider a set (also called a system) of mlinear equations in nvariables or un- knownsx1;:::;xn: A11x1+A12x2+\u0001\u0001\u0001+A1nxn=b1 A21x1+A22x2+\u0001\u0001\u0001+A2nxn=b2 ::: Am1x1+Am2x2+\u0001\u0001\u0001+Amnxn=bm: The numbers Aijare called the coe\u000ecients in the linear equations, and the numbers biare called the right-hand sides (since by tradition, they appear on the right-hand\n",

      "3622 (27) Compute QTb. 3.Back substitution. Solve the triangular equation Rx=QTbusing back substi- tution. The rst step requires 2 n3 ops (seex5.4), the second step requires 2 n2 ops, and the third step requires n2 ops. The total number of ops is then 2n3+ 3n2\u00192n3; so the order is n3, cubic in the number of variables, which is the same as the number of equations. In the complexity analysis above, we found that the rst step, the QR factor- ization, dominates the other two; that is, the cost of the other two is negligible in comparison to the cost of the rst step. This has some interesting practical implications, which we discuss below. Factor-solve methods. Algorithm 11.2 is similar to many methods for solving a set of linear equations and is sometimes referred to as a factor-solve scheme. A factor-solve scheme consists of two steps. In the rst (factor) step the coe\u000ecient matrix is factored as a product of matrices with special properties. In the second (solve) step one or more linear equations that involve the factors in the factorization are solved. (In algorithm 11.2, the solve step consists of steps 2 and 3.) The complexity of the solve step is smaller than the complexity of the factor step, and in many cases, it is negligible by comparison. This is the case in algorithm 11.2, where the factor step has order n3and the solve step has order n2. Factor-solve methods with multiple right-hand sides. Now suppose that we must solve several sets of linear equations, Ax1=b1; :::; Ax k=bk;11.3 Solving linear equations 209 all with the same coe\u000ecient matrix A, but di erent right-hand sides. We can express this as the matrix equation AX=B, whereXis then\u0002kmatrix with columnsx1;:::;xk, andBis then\u0002kmatrix with columns b1;:::;bk(see page 180). AssumingAis invertible, the solution of AX=BisX=A\u00001B. A na \u0010ve way to solve the kproblemsAxi=bi(or in matrix notation, compute X=A\u00001B) is to apply algorithm 11.2 ktimes, which costs 2 kn3 ops. A more e\u000ecient method exploits the fact that Ais the same matrix in each problem, so we can re-use the matrix factorization in step 1 and only need to repeat steps 2 and 3 to compute ^ xk=R\u00001QTbkforl= 1;:::;k . (This is sometimes referred to asfactorization caching , since we save or cache the factorization after carrying it out, for later use.) The cost of this method is 2 n3+ 3kn2 ops, or approximately 2n3 ops ifk n. The (surprising) conclusion is that we can solve multiple sets of linear equations, with the same coe\u000ecient matrix A, at essentially the same cost as solving oneset of linear equations. Backslash notation. In several software packages for manipulating matrices, Anb is taken to mean the solution of Ax=b,i.e.,A\u00001b, whenAis invertible. This backslash notation is extended to matrix right-hand sides: AnB, withBann\u0002k matrix, denotes A\u00001B, the solution of the matrix equation AX=B. (The compu- tation is implemented as described above, by factoring Ajust once, and carrying outkback substitutions.) This backslash notation is not standard mathematical notation, however, so we will not use it in this book. Computing the matrix inverse. We can now describe a method to compute the inverseB=A\u00001of an (invertible) n\u0002nmatrixA. We rst compute the QR factorization of A, soA\u00001=R\u00001QT. We can write this as RB=QT, which, written out by columns is Rbi= ~qi; i= 1;:::;n; wherebiis theith column of Band ~qiis theith column of QT. We can solve these equations using back substitution, to get the columns of the inverse B.

      "4238 (28) Fori= 1;:::;n , Solve the triangular equation Rbi= ~qiusing back substitution. The complexity of this method is 2 n3 ops (for the QR factorization) and n3for nback substitutions, each of which costs n2 ops. So we can compute the matrix inverse in around 3 n3 ops. This gives an alternative method for solving the square set of linear equations Ax=b: We rst compute the inverse matrix A\u00001, and then the matrix-vector productx= (A\u00001)b. This method has a higher op count than directly solving210 11 Matrix inverses the equations using algorithm 11.2 (3 n3versus 2n3), so algorithm 11.2 is the usual method of choice. While the matrix inverse appears in many formulas (such as the solution of a set of linear equations), it is computed far less often. Sparse linear equations. Systems of linear equations with sparse coe\u000ecient ma- trix arise in many applications. By exploiting the sparsity of the coe\u000ecient matrix, these linear equations can be solved far more e\u000eciently than by using the generic algorithm 11.2. One method is to use the same basic algorithm 11.2, replacing the QR factorization with a variant that handles sparse matrices (see page 190). The memory usage and complexity of these methods depends in a complicated way on the sparsity pattern of the coe\u000ecient matrix. In order, the memory usage is typically a modest multiple of nnz(A) +n, the number of scalars required to specify the problem data Aandb, which is typically much smaller than n2+n, the number of scalars required to store Aandbif they are not sparse. The op count for solving sparse linear equations is also typically closer in order to nnz(A) than n3, the order when the matrix Ais not sparse. 11.4 Examples Polynomial interpolation. The 4-vector cgives the coe\u000ecients of a cubic polyno- mial, p(x) =c1+c2x+c3x2+c4x3 (see pages 154 and 120). We seek the coe\u000ecients that satisfy p(\u00001:1) =b1; p (\u00000:4) =b2; p (0:2) =b3; p (0:8) =b4: We can express this as the system of 4 equations in 4 variables Ac=b, where A=2 6641\u00001:1 (\u00001:1)2(\u00001:1)3 1\u00000:4 (\u00000:4)2(\u00000:4)3 1 0:2 (0:2)2(0:2)3 1 0:8 (0:8)2(0:8)33 775; which is a speci c Vandermonde matrix (see (6.7)). The unique solution is c= A\u00001b, where A\u00001=2 664\u00000:5784 1:9841\u00002:1368 0:7310 0:3470 0:1984\u00001:4957 0:9503 0:1388\u00001:8651 1:6239 0:1023 \u00000:0370 0:3492 0:7521\u00000:06433 775 (to 4 decimal places). This is illustrated in gure 11.1, which shows the two cu- bic polynomials that interpolate the two sets of points shown as lled circles and squares, respectively. The columns of A\u00001are interesting: They give the coe\u000ecients of a polynomial that evaluates to 0 at three of the points, and 1 at the other point. For example, the11.4 Examples 211 −1.5−1−0.5 0 0.5 1xp(x) Figure 11.1 Cubic interpolants through two sets of points, shown as circles and squares. rst column of A\u00001, which isA\u00001e1, gives the coe\u000ecients of the polynomial that has value 1 at\u00001:1, and value 0 at \u00000:4, 0:2, and 0:8. The four polynomials with coe\u000ecients given by the columns of A\u00001are called the Lagrange polynomials asso- ciated with the points \u00001:1,\u00000:4, 0:2, 0:8. These are plotted in gure 11.2. (The Lagrange polynomials are named after the mathematician Joseph-Louis Lagrange, whose name will re-appear in several other contexts.) The rows of A\u00001are also interesting: The ith row shows how the values b1, . . . ,b4, the polynomial values at the points \u00001:1,\u00000:4, 0:2, 0:8, map into the ith coe\u000ecient of the polynomial, ci. For example, we see that the coe\u000ecient c4is not very sensitive to the value of b1(since (A\u00001)41is small). We can also see that for each increase of one in b4, the coe\u000ecient c2increases by around 0 :95. Balancing chemical reactions. (See page 154 for background.)

Let A=QRbe the QR factorization of A(which exists by our assumption (12.2) that its columns are linearly independent).

      "7163 (33) Compute QTb. 3.Back substitution. Solve the triangular equation R^x=QTb. Comparison to solving a square system of linear equations. Recall that the solution of the square invertible system of linear equations Ax=bisx=A\u00001b. We can express xusing the QR factorization of Aasx=R\u00001QTb(see (11.4)). This equation is formally identical to (12.10). The only di erence is that in (12.10), A andQneed not be square, and R\u00001QTbis the least squares approximate solution, which is not (in general) a solution of Ax=b. Indeed, algorithm 12.1 is formally the same as algorithm 11.2, the QR fac- torization method for solving linear equations. (The only di erence is that in algorithm 12.1, AandQcan be tall.) WhenAis square, solving the linear equations Ax=band the least squares problem of minimizing kAx\u0000bk2are the same, and algorithm 11.2 and algo- rithm 12.1 are the same. So we can think of algorithm 12.1 as a generalization of algorithm 11.2, which solves the equation Ax=bwhenAis square, and computes the least squares approximate solution when Ais tall. Backslash notation. Several software packages for manipulating matrices extend the backslash operator (see page 209) to mean the least squares approximate solu- tion of an over-determined set of linear equations. In these packages Anbis taken to mean the solution A\u00001bofAx=bwhenAis square and invertible, and the least squares approximate solution AybwhenAis tall and has linearly indepen- dent columns. (We remind the reader that this backslash notation is not standard mathematical notation.) Complexity. The complexity of the rst step of algorithm 12.1 is 2 mn2 ops. The second step involves a matrix-vector multiplication, which takes 2 mn ops. The third step requires n2 ops. The total number of ops is 2mn2+ 2mn+n2\u00192mn2; neglecting the second and third terms, which are smaller than the rst by factors ofnand 2m, respectively. The order of the algorithm is mn2. The complexity is linear in the row dimension of Aand quadratic in the number of variables. Sparse least squares. Least squares problems with sparse Aarise in several appli- cations and can be solved more e\u000eciently, for example by using a QR factorization tailored for sparse matrices (see page 190) in the generic algorithm 12.1.12.3 Solving least squares problems 233 Another simple approach for exploiting sparsity of Ais to solve the normal equationsATA^x=ATbby solving a larger (but sparse) system of equations, \u0014 0AT A I\u0015\u0014^x ^y\u0015 =\u00140 b\u0015 : (12.11) This is a square set of m+nlinear equations. Its coe\u000ecient matrix is sparse when A is sparse. If (^ x;^y) satis es these equations, it is easy to see that ^ xsatis es (12.11); conversely, if ^ xsatis es the normal equations, (^ x;^y) satis es (12.11) with ^ y= b\u0000A^x. Any method for solving a sparse system of linear equations can be used to solve (12.11). Matrix least squares. A simple extension of the least squares problem is to choose then\u0002kmatrixXso as to minimize kAX\u0000Bk2. HereAis anm\u0002nmatrix and Bis anm\u0002kmatrix, and the norm is the matrix norm. This is sometimes called thematrix least squares problem . Whenk= 1,xandbare vectors, and the matrix least squares problem reduces to the usual least squares problem. The matrix least squares problem is in fact nothing but a set of kordinary least squares problems. To see this, we note that kAX\u0000Bk2=kAx1\u0000b1k2+\u0001\u0001\u0001+kAxk\u0000bkk2; wherexjis thejth column of Xandbjis thejth column of B. (Here we use the property that the square of the matrix norm is the sum of the squared norms of the columns of the matrix.) So the objective is a sum of kterms, with each term depending on only one column of X. It follows that we can choose the columns xj independently, each one by minimizing its associated term kAxj\u0000bjk2. Assuming thatAhas linearly independent columns, the solution is ^ xj=Aybj. The solution of the matrix least squares problem is therefore ^X=\u0002 ^x1\u0001\u0001\u0001 ^xk\u0003 =\u0002 Ayb1\u0001\u0001\u0001Aybk\u0003 =Ay\u0002b1\u0001\u0001\u0001bk\u0003 =AyB: (12.12) The very simple solution ^X=AyBof the matrix least squares problem agrees with the solution of the ordinary least squares problem when k= 1 (as it must). Many software packages for linear algebra use the backslash operator AnBto denoteAyB, but this is not standard mathematical notation. The matrix least squares problem can be solved e\u000eciently by exploiting the fact that algorithm 12.1 is another example of a factor-solve algorithm. To compute ^X=AyBwe carry out the QR factorization of Aonce; we carry out steps 2 and 3 of algorithm 12.1 for each of the kcolumns ofB. The total cost is 2 mn2+k(2mn+n2) ops. When kis small compared to nthis is roughly 2 mn2 ops, the same cost as solving a single least squares problem ( i.e., one with a vector right-hand side).234 12 Least squares 12.4 Examples Advertising purchases. We havemdemographic groups or audiences that we want to advertise to, with a target number of impressions or views for each group, which we give as a vector vdes. (The entries are positive.) To reach these audiences, we purchase advertising in ndi erent channels (say, di erent web publishers, radio, print, . . . ), in amounts that we give as an n-vectors. (The entries of sare non- negative, which we ignore.) The m\u0002nmatrixRgives the number of impressions in each group per dollar spending in the channels: Rijis the number of impres- sions in group iper dollar spent on advertising in channel j. (These entries are estimated, and are nonnegative.) The jth column of Rgives the e ectiveness or reach (in impressions per dollar) for channel j. Theith row ofRshows which media demographic group iis exposed to. The total number of impressions in each demographic group is the m-vectorv, which is given by v=Rs. The goal is to ndsso thatv=Rs\u0019vdes. We can do this using least squares, by choosing sto minimizekRs\u0000vdesk2. (We are not guaranteed that the resulting channel spend vector will be nonnegative.) This least squares formulation does not take into account the total cost of the advertising; we will see in chapter 16 how this can be done. We consider a simple numerical example, with n= 3 channels and m= 10 demographic groups, and matrix R=2 6666666666666640:97 1:86 0:41 1:23 2:18 0:53 0:80 1:24 0:62 1:29 0:98 0:51 1:10 1:23 0:69 0:67 0:34 0:54 0:87 0:26 0:62 1:10 0:16 0:48 1:92 0:22 0:71 1:29 0:12 0:623 777777777777775; with units of 1000 views per dollar. The entries of Rrange over an 18:1 range, so the 3 channels are quite di erent in terms of their audience reach; see gure 12.3. We takevdes= (103)1,i.e., our goal is to reach one million customers in each of the 10 demographic groups. Least squares gives the advertising budget allocation ^s= (62;100;1443); which achieves a views vector with RMS error 132, or 13 :2% of the target values. The views vector is shown in gure 12.4. Illumination. A set ofnlamps illuminates an area that we divide into mregions or pixels. We let lidenote the lighting level in region i, so them-vectorlgives the illumination levels across all regions. We let pidenote the power at which lamp ioperates, so the n-vectorpgives the set of lamp powers. (The lamp powers are nonnegative and also must not exceed a maximum allowed power, but we ignore these issues here.)\n",
      "615 (34) Another example is an original feature that takes on the values 1 ;2;:::; 7, representing the day of the week. Such features are called categorical in statistics, since they specify which category the example is in, and not some real number. Expanding a categorical feature with lvalues means replacing it with a set of l\u00001 new features, each of which is Boolean, and simply records whether or not the original feature has the associated value. (When all these features are zero, it means the original feature had the default value.) As an example, suppose the original feature x1takes on only the values \u00001, 0, and\n",
      "235 (35) Using the feature value 0 as the default feature value, we replace x1with the two mapped features f1(x) =\u001a1x1=\u00001 0 otherwise ;f2(x) =\u001a1x1= 1 0 otherwise : In words,f1(x) tells us ifx1has the value\u00001, andf2(x) tells us ifx1has the value\n",
      "1700 (36) (We do not need a new feature for the default value x1= 0; this corresponds to f1(x) =f2(x) = 0.) This feature mapping is shown in table 13.3. Expanding a categorical feature with lvalues into l\u00001 features that encode whether the feature has one of the (non-default) values is sometimes called one-hot encoding , because for any data example, only one of the new feature values is one, and the others are zero. (When the original feature has the default value, all the new features are zero.)13.3 Feature engineering 271 x1f1(x)f2(x) \u00001 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 Table 13.3 The original categorical feature x1takes on only the three values listed in the rst column. This feature is replaced with (expanded into) the two features f1(x) andf2(x) shown in the second and third columns. There is no need to expand an original feature that is Boolean ( i.e., takes on two values). If the original Boolean feature is encoded with the values 0 and 1, and 0 is taken as the default value, then the one new feature value will be the same as the original feature value. As an example of expanding categoricals, consider a model that is used to predict house prices based on various features that include the number of bedrooms, that ranges from 1 to 5 (say). In the basic regression model, we use the number of bedrooms directly as a feature. In the basic model there is one parameter value that corresponds to value per bedroom; we multiply this parameter by the number of bedrooms to get the contribution to our price prediction. In this model, the price prediction increases (or decreases) by the same amount when we change the number of bedrooms from 1 to 2 as it does when we change the number of bedrooms from 4 to\n",
      "868 (37) If we expand this categorical feature, using 2 bedrooms as the default, we have 4 Boolean features that correspond to a house having 1, 3, 4, and 5 bedrooms. We then have 4 parameters in our model, which assign di erent amounts to add to our prediction for houses with 1, 3, 4, and 5 bedrooms, respectively. This more exible model can capture the idea that a change from 1 to 2 bedrooms is di erent from a change from 4 to 5 bedrooms. Generalized additive model. We introduce new features that are nonlinear func- tions of the original features, such as, for each xi, the functions min fxi+a;0g and maxfxi\u0000b;0g, whereaandbare parameters. These new features are readily interpreted: minfxi+a;0gis the amount by which feature xiis below\u0000a, and maxfxi\u0000b;0gis the amount by which feature xiis aboveb. A common choice, assuming that xihas already been standardized, is a=b=\n",
      "1495 (38) This leads to the predictor ^y= 1(x1) +\u0001\u0001\u0001+ n(xn); (13.5) where iis the piecewise-linear function i(xi) =\u0012n+iminfxi+a;0g+\u0012ixi+\u00122n+imaxfxi\u0000b;0g; (13.6) which has kink or knot points at the values \u0000aand +b. The model (13.5) has 3 n parameters, corresponding to the original features, and the two additional features per original feature. The prediction ^ yis a sum of functions of the original features, and is called a generalized additive model . (More complex versions add more than two additional functions of each original feature.)272 13 Least squares data tting −1 1 −0.50.5 x1ψ1(x1) −1 1 −0.50.5 x2ψ2(x2) Figure 13.14 The functions iin (13.6) for n= 2,a=b= 1, and\u00121= 0:5, \u00122=\u00000:4,\u00123= 0:3,\u00124=\u00000:2,\u00125=\u00000:3,\u00126= 0:2. Consider an example with n= 2 original features. Our prediction ^ yis a sum of two piecewise-linear functions, each depending on one of the original features. Figure 13.14 shows an example. In this example model, we can say that increasing x1increases our prediction ^ y; but for high values of x1(i.e., above 1) the increase in the prediction is less pronounced, and for low values ( i.e., below\u00001), it is more pronounced. Products and interactions. New features can be developed from pairs of original features, for example, their product. From the original features we can add xixj, fori;j= 1;:::;n ,i\u0014j. Products are used to model interactions among the features. Product features are easily interpretable when the original features are Boolean, i.e., take the values 0 or\n",
      "5700 (39) Thus xi= 1 means that feature iis present or has occurred, and the new product feature xixjhas the value 1 exactly when both feature iandjhave occurred. Strati ed models. In a strati ed model , we have several di erent sub-models, and choose the one to use depending on the values of the regressors. For example, instead of treating gender as a regressor in a single model of some medical outcome, we build two di erent sub-models, one for male patients and one for female patients. In this case we choose the sub-model to use based on one of the original features, gender. As a more general example, we can carry out clustering of the original feature vectors, and t a separate model within each cluster. To evaluate ^ yfor a newx, we rst determine which cluster xis in, and then use the associated model. Whether or not a strati ed model is a good idea is checked using out-of-sample validation.13.3 Feature engineering 273 13.3.3 Advanced feature generation methods Custom mappings. In many applications custom mappings of the raw data are used as additional features, in addition to the original features given. For example in a model meant to predict an asset's future price using prior prices, we might also use the highest and lowest prices over the last week. Another well known example in nancial models is the price-to-earnings ratio, constructed from the price and (last) earnings features. In document analysis applications word count features are typically replaced with term frequency inverse document frequency (TFIDF) values, which scale the raw count values by a function of the frequency with which the word appears across the given set of documents, usually in such a way that uncommon words are given more weight. (There are many variations on the particular scaling function to use. Which one to use in a given application can be determined by out-of-sample or cross-validation.) Predictions from other models. In many applications there are existing models for the data. A common trick is to use the predictions of these models as features in your model. In this case you can describe your model as one that combines or blends the raw data available with predictions made from one or more existing models to create a new prediction. Distance to cluster representatives. We can build new features from a clustering of the data into kgroups. One simple method uses the cluster representatives z1;:::;zk, and gives knew features, given by f(x) =e\u0000kx\u0000zik2=\u001b2, where\u001bis a parameter. Random features. The new features are given by a nonlinear function of a random linear combination of the original features. To add Knew features of this type, we rst generate a random K\u0002nmatrixR. We then generate new features as (Rx)+orjRxj, where (\u0001)+andj\u0001jare applied elementwise to the vector Rx. (Other nonlinear functions can be used as well.) This approach to generating new features is quite counter-intuitive, since you would imagine that feature engineering should be done using detailed knowledge of, and intuition about, the particular application. Nevertheless this method can be very e ective in some applications. Neural network features. Aneural network computes transformed features using compositions of linear transformations interspersed with nonlinear mappings such as the absolute value. This architecture was originally inspired by biology, as a crude model of how human and animal brains work. The ideas behind neural networks are very old, but their use has accelerated over the last few years due to a combination of new techniques, greatly increased computing power, and access to large amounts of data. Neural networks can nd good feature mappings directly from the data, provided there is a very large amount of data available.274 13 Least squares data tting 13.3.4 Summary The discussion above makes it clear that there is much art in choosing features to use in a model. But it is important to keep several things in mind when creating new features: \u000fTry simple models rst. Start with a constant, then a simple regression model, and so on. You can compare more sophisticated models against these. \u000fCompare competing candidate models using validation. Adding new features will always reduce the RMS error on the training data, but the important question is whether or not it substantially reduces the RMS error on the test or validation data sets. (We add the quali er `substantially' here because a small reduction in test set error is not meaningful.) \u000fAdding new features can easily lead to over- t. (This will show up when validating the model.) The most straightforward way to avoid over- t is to keep the model simple. We mention here that another approach to avoiding over- t, called regularization (covered in chapter 15), can be very e ective when combined with feature engineering. 13.3.5 House price prediction In this section we use feature engineering to develop a more complicated regres- sion model for the house sales data, illustrating some of the methods described above. As mentioned in x2.3, the data set contains records of 774 house sales in the Sacramento area. For our more complex model we will use four base attributes or original features: \u000fx1is the area of the house (in 1000 square feet), \u000fx2is the number of bedrooms, \u000fx3is equal to one if the property is a condominium, and zero otherwise, \u000fx4is the ve-digit ZIP code. Only the rst two attributes were used in the simple regression model ^y= 1x1+ 2x2+v given inx2.3. In that model, we do not carry out any feature engineering or modi cation. Feature engineering. Here we examine a more complicated model, with 8 basis functions, ^y=8X i=1\u0012ifi(x): These basis functions are described below.\n",
      "739 (40) The density of the object we are imaging is shown in gure 15.9. In this object the density of each pixel is either 0 or 1 (shown as white or black, respectively). We reconstruct or estimate the object density from the 4000 (noisy) line integral measurements by solving the regularized least squares problem minimizekAx\u0000yk2+\u0015kDxk2; wherekDxk2is the sum of squares of the di erences of the pixel values from their neighbors. Figure 15.10 shows the results for six di erent values of \u0015. We can see that for small \u0015the reconstruction is relatively sharp, but su ers from noise. For large\u0015the noise in the reconstruction is smaller, but it is too smooth. 15.4 Regularized data tting We consider least squares data tting, as described in chapter\n",
      "3844 (41) In x13.2 we con- sidered the issue of over- tting, where the model performs poorly on new, unseen data, which occurs when the model is too complicated for the given data set. The remedy is to keep the model simple, e.g., by tting with a polynomial of not too high a degree. Regularization is another way to avoid over- tting, di erent from simply choos- ing a model that is simple ( i.e., does not have too many basis functions). Regular- ization is also called de-tuning ,shrinkage , or ridge regression , for reasons we will explain below.326 15 Multi-objective least squares Figure 15.8 The square region at the center of the picture is surrounded by 100 points shown as circles. 40 lines (beams) emanate from each point. (The lines are shown for two points only.) This gives a total of 4000 lines that intersect the region. .

To motivate regularization, consider the model ^f(x) =\u00121f1(x) +\u0001\u0001\u0001+\u0012pfp(x): (15.6) We can interpret \u0012ias the amount by which our prediction depends on fi(x), so if\u0012iis large, our prediction will be very sensitive to changes or variations in the value offi(x), such as those we might expect in new, unseen data. This suggests that we should prefer that \u0012ibe small, so our model is not too sensitive. There is one exception here: if fi(x) is constant (for example, the number one), then we should not worry about the size of \u0012i, sincefi(x) never varies. But we would like all the others to be small, if possible. This suggests the bi-criterion least squares problem with primary objective ky\u0000A\u0012k2, the sum of squares of the prediction errors, and secondary objective k\u00122:pk2, assuming that f1is the constant function one. Thus we should minimize ky\u0000A\u0012k2+\u0015k\u00122:pk2; (15.7) where\u0015>0 is called the regularization parameter . For the regression model, this weighted objective can be expressed as ky\u0000XT \u0000v1k2+\u0015k k2: Here we penalize being large (because this leads to sensitivity of the model), but not the o set v. Choosing to minimize this weighted objective is called ridge regression . E ect of regularization. The e ect of the regularization is to accept a worse value of sum square t ( ky\u0000A\u0012k2) in return for a smaller value of k\u00122:pk2, which measures the size of the parameters (except \u00121, which is associated with the constant basis function). This explains the name shrinkage: The parameters are smaller than they would be without regularization, i.e., they are shrunk. The term de-tuned suggests that with regularization, the model is not excessively `tuned' to the training data (which would lead to over- t). Regularization path. We get a di erent model for every choice of \u0015. The way the parameters change with \u0015is called the regularization path . Whenpis small enough (say, less than 15 or so) the parameter values can be plotted, with \u0015on the horizontal axis. Usually only 30 or 50 values of \u0015are considered, typically spaced logarithmically over a large range (see page 314). An appropriate value of \u0015can be chosen via out-of-sample or cross-validation. As\u0015increases, the RMS t on the training data worsens (increases). But (as with model order) the test set RMS prediction error typically decreases as \u0015increases, and then, when \u0015gets too big, it increases. A good choice of regularization pa- rameter is one which approximately minimizes the test set RMS prediction error. When multiple values of \u0015approximately minimize the RMS error, common prac- tice is to take the largest value of \u0015. The idea here is to use the model of minimum sensitivity, as measured by k k2, among those that make good predictions on the test set.\n",
      "84 (42) After that it applies zero force, so the mass stays where it is, at rest at position\n",
      "4811 (43) The superscript `bb' refers to bang-bang , which means that a large force is applied to get the mass moving (the rst `bang') and another large force (the second `bang') is then applied to slow it to zero velocity. The force and position versus time for this choice of fare shown in gure 16.3. Now we ask, what is the smallest force sequence that can achieve v n= 0, p n= 1, where smallest is measured by the sum of squares of the applied forces, kfk2=f2 1+\u0001\u0001\u0001+f2 10?

The solution fln, and the resulting position, are shown in g- ure 16.4.

We will use the method of La- grange multipliers (developed by the mathematician Joseph-Louis Lagrange, and summarized inxC.3) to solve the constrained least squares problem (16.1). Later we give an independent veri cation, that does not rely on calculus or Lagrange multipliers, that the solution we derive is correct. We rst write the constrained least squares problem with the constraints given as a list ofpscalar equality constraints: minimizekAx\u0000bk2 subject to cT ix=di; i= 1;:::;p; wherecT iare the rows of C. We form the Lagrangian function L(x;z) =kAx\u0000bk2+z1(cT 1x\u0000d1) +\u0001\u0001\u0001+zp(cT px\u0000dp); wherezis thep-vector of Lagrange multipliers . The method of Lagrange multipliers tells us that if ^ xis a solution of the constrained least squares problem, then there is a set of Lagrange multipliers ^ zthat satisfy @L @xi(^x;^z) = 0; i= 1;:::;n;@L @zi(^x;^z) = 0; i= 1;:::;p: (16.3) These are the optimality conditions for the constrained least squares problem. Any solution of the constrained least squares problem must satisfy them. We will now see that the optimality conditions can be expressed as a set of linear equations. The second set of equations in the optimality conditions can be written as @L @zi(^x;^z) =cT i^x\u0000di= 0; i= 1;:::;p;16.2 Solution 345 which states that ^ xsatis es the equality constraints C^x=d(which we already knew). The rst set of equations, however, is more informative. Expanding the objectivekAx\u0000bk2as a sum of terms involving the entries of x(as was done on page 229) and taking the partial derivative of Lwith respect to xiwe obtain @L @xi(^x;^z) = 2nX j=1(ATA)ij^xj\u00002(ATb)i+pX j=1^zj(cj)i= 0: These equations can be written in compact matrix-vector form as 2(ATA)^x\u00002ATb+CT^z= 0: Combining this set of linear equations with the feasibility conditions C^x=d, we can write the optimality conditions (16.3) as one set of n+plinear equations in the variables (^ x;^z): \u0014 2ATA CT C 0\u0015\u0014^x ^z\u0015 =\u0014 2ATb d\u0015 : (16.4) These equations are called the KKT equations for the constrained least squares problem. (KKT are the initials of the last names of William Karush, Harold Kuhn, and Albert Tucker, the three researchers who derived the optimality con- ditions for a more general form of constrained optimization problem.) The KKT equations (16.4) are an extension of the normal equations (12.4) for a least squares problem with no constraints. So we have reduced the constrained least squares problem to the problem of solving a (square) set of n+plinear equations in n+p variables (^x;^z). Invertibility of KKT matrix. The (n+p)\u0002(n+p) coe\u000ecient matrix in (16.4) is called the KKT matrix . It is invertible if and only if Chas linearly independent rows, and\u0014A C\u0015 has linearly independent columns . (16.5) The rst condition requires that Cis wide (or square), i.e., that there are fewer constraints than variables. The second condition depends on both AandC, and it can be satis ed even when the columns of Aare linearly dependent. The con- dition (16.5) is the generalization of our assumption (12.2) for unconstrained least squares ( i.e., thatAhas linearly independent columns). Before proceeding, let us verify that the KKT matrix is invertible if and only if (16.5) holds. First suppose that the KKT matrix is not invertible. This means that there is a nonzero vector (\u0016 x;\u0016z) with \u0014 2ATA CT C 0\u0015\u0014 \u0016x \u0016z\u0015 = 0: Multiply the top block equation 2 ATA\u0016x+CT\u0016z= 0 on the left by \u0016 xTto get 2kA\u0016xk2+ \u0016xTCT\u0016z= 0:346 16 Constrained least squares The second block equation, C\u0016x= 0, implies (by taking the transpose) \u0016 xTCT= 0, so the equation above becomes 2 kA\u0016xk2= 0, i.e.,A\u0016x=\n",
      "137 (44) We also have C\u0016x= 0, so \u0014A C\u0015 \u0016x= 0: Since the matrix on the left has linearly independent columns (by assumption), we conclude that \u0016 x=\n",
      "81 (46) But by our assumption that the columns of CTare linearly independent, we have \u0016z=\n",
      "170 (47) So (\u0016x;\u0016z) = 0, which is a contradiction. The converse is also true. First suppose that the rows of Care linearly depen- dent. Then there is a nonzero vector \u0016 zwithCT\u0016z=\n",
      "1209 (48) Then \u0014 2ATA CT C 0\u0015\u00140 \u0016z\u0015 = 0; which shows the KKT matrix is not invertible. Now suppose that the stacked matrix in (16.5) has linearly dependent columns, which means there is a nonzero vector \u0016xfor which \u0014A C\u0015 \u0016x= 0: Direct calculation shows that \u0014 2ATA CT C 0\u0015\u0014 \u0016x 0\u0015 = 0; which shows that the KKT matrix is not invertible. When the conditions (16.5) hold, the constrained least squares problem (16.1) has the (unique) solution ^ x, given by \u0014^x ^z\u0015 =\u0014 2ATA CT C 0\u0015\u00001\u0014 2ATb d\u0015 : (16.6) (This formula also gives us ^ z, the set of Lagrange multipliers.) From (16.6), we observe that the solution ^ xis a linear function of ( b;d). Direct veri cation of constrained least squares solution. We will now show directly, without using calculus, that the solution ^ xgiven in (16.6) is the unique vector that minimizes kAx\u0000bk2over allxthat satisfy the constraints Cx=d, when the conditions (16.5) hold. Let ^ xand ^zdenote the vectors given in (16.6), so they satisfy 2ATA^x+CT^z= 2ATb; C ^x=d: Suppose that x6= ^xis any vector that satis es Cx=d. We will show that kAx\u0000bk2>kA^x\u0000bk2. We proceed in the same way as for the least squares problem: kAx\u0000bk2=k(Ax\u0000A^x) + (A^x\u0000b)k2 =kAx\u0000A^xk2+kA^x\u0000bk2+ 2(Ax\u0000A^x)T(A^x\u0000b):\n",
      "870 (49) We rst consider the Boolean problem of recognizing the digit zero. We use linear features, i.e., ~f(x) =xT +v; wherexis the 493-vector of pixel intensities. To determine the parameters vand we solve the nonlinear least squares problem minimizeNX i=1( ((x(i))T +v)\u0000y(i))2+\u0015k k2; (18.18) where is the sigmoid function (18.16) and \u0015is a positive regularization parameter. (This\u0015is the regularization parameter in the classi cation problem; it has no relation to the trust parameter \u0015(k)in the iterates of the Levenberg{Marquardt algorithm.) Figure 18.17 shows the classi cation error on the training and test sets as a function of the regularization parameter \u0015. For\u0015= 100, the classi cation errors on the training and test sets are about 0 :7%. This is less than half the 1 :6% error of the Boolean least squares classi er that used the same features, discussed in chapter\n",
      "1281 (50) This improvement in performance, by more than a factor of two, comes from minimizing an objective that is closer to what we want ( i.e., the number of prediction errors on the training set) than the surrogate linear least squares objective. The confusion matrices for the training set and test set are given in table 18.1.

      "1536 (51) Convergence of Levenberg{Marquardt algorithm. The Levenberg{Marquardt algorithm is used to compute the parameters in the nonlinear least squares classi er. In this example the algorithm takes several tens of iterations to converge, i.e., until the stopping criterion for the nonlinear least squares problem is satis ed. But in this application we are more interested in the performance of the classi er, and not minimizing the objective of the nonlinear least squares problem. Figure 18.19 shows the classi cation error of the classi er (on the training and test data sets) with parameter \u0012(k), thekth iterate of the Levenberg{Marquardt algorithm. We can see that the classi cation errors reach their nal values of 0 :7% after just a few iterations. This phenomenon is very typical in nonlinear data tting problems. Well before convergence, the Levenberg{Marquardt algorithm nds model parameters that are just as good (as judged by test error) as the parameters obtained when the algorithm converges. Feature engineering. After adding the 5000 random features used in chapter 14, we obtain the training and test classi cation errors shown in gure 18.20. The error on the training set is zero for small \u0015. For\u0015= 1000, the error on the test set is 0:24%, with the confusion matrix in table 18.2.
